## Interests

My main interests are quantum and classical information theories. 

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/isadays/isadays/blob/main/CodeCogsEqn.png)

I build and develop data analysis (and exploratory analysis) in Python and R to identify patterns. I study artificial neural networks architectures to improve the models accuracy. I love to simulate and interpret nature through equations and codes.
